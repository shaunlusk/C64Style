  separate element mouse down events? - separate from mouse down/up/over?

make sprite frames consistent - image frames use duration first then props; pix sprites use pix array first then duration

throw error on unimplemented methods in layer?

ability set sprite frame idx manually, turn off frame duration

demos
  Better sprite demo
  ---x drag and drop / mouse events
  mouse over

per layer events
  before / after render

Sprite.prototype.doEndOfAnimation

clean up move order
make move order work with pause

MOUSE_OVER_ELEMENT vs MOUSE_MOVE_OVER_ELEMENT
MOUSE_OUT event?

7 & 1 = chalice?

add additional char maps
  person
  caret
  tilda
  curly braces

textSprite?

tests for
  priority queue
