### Known issues
###############################################################################
MoveOrders do not take pause into account and so will tend to cause elements to "jump" to final destination when screen is resumed.
This is probably ok though: in text layer, strings that are rendered in same frame may be written on top of eachother without clearing (clearing comes before drawing)
