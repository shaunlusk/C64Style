element finalize

### Future work
###############################################################################
make move order work with pause
screen
  separate element mouse down events? - separate from mouse down/up/over?
throw error on unimplemented methods in layer?
option for disabling collision checking - and force full clear and redraw?
ability set sprite frame idx manually, turn off frame duration
per layer events
  before / after render
loading indicator & demo
textSprite?
Bounds checking on text layer?
Text wrapping on text layer?

###############################################################################
### Known issues
###############################################################################
This is probably ok though: in text layer, strings that are rendered in same frame may be written on top of eachother without clearing (clearing comes before drawing)
