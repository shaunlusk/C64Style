on screen - get unscaled x & y - or have scaled x & y

implement get renderer
gfxlayer  - remove all elements
screen.getWidth incorporates total scale, but should what about unscaled values?

move element from one layer to another
  parentLayer
  canvasContext

careful with classes - ensur ethey can be easily overridden;
  TextLayer - blows up w/o characterRenderer

screen
  mousemove tracking doesn't need to calculate row/col til event is actually issued

drawborder:

### Known issues
###############################################################################
MoveOrders do not take pause into account and so will tend to cause elements to "jump" to final destination when screen is resumed.
This is probably ok though: in text layer, strings that are rendered in same frame may be written on top of eachother without clearing (clearing comes before drawing)
